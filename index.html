The Web Aint Hard

At Patreon we're getting an opportunity to refactor an web application
that serves at lot of people! So in that process we've hired people who've
worked on all sorts of web applications: Angular, React, and Ember
being the most popular.

At the end of the day these are all just tools. We'll explore how to simplify
your toolbelt and deploy a realtime static html app in minutes.

- Utilizing services for infrastructure
- Sane Frontend/JavaScript development w/ NPM and CommonJS modules
- Focus on solving your domain problem, not maintaining it
- Hosting and realtime data storage for cheap

By the end you'll be saying "The Web Aint Hard".
